#### Students PhD Requirements

This is a summary of the requirements for obtaining a PhD degree from our group. Students should familiarize with the content and are welcome to ask questions and discuss the requirements.

Incoming students will take approximately one year to complete class requirements and begin laboratory and research work. On their first and second year, they will be leading multiple start up projects (pre-project, usually equivalent to a MS thesis). They will be required to publish designs and results based on these projects. Student will be evaluated in this phase and encouraged or discouraged to proceed with the degree requirements. On their fourth and fifth year students will be required to show autonomous ability to conduct research. Students are required at all times to work in the laboratory next to other students and lab member for no less than 8 hours per day on a regular basis.

The requirement for graduation and successful thesis submission are:

+ Show analytical modeling of the pre-project results and ability to select the appropriate technologies to improve the results obtained in the pre-project.
+ Show that their modeling can satisfy tighter requirements and deliver significant improvement over the pre-project results.
+ Fabricate, test and instrument an advanced version of the pre-project and confirm analysis. Repeat this step multiple times until significant improvements are reached and documented in publications.
+ Demonstrate original work where the main conceptual advances are the fruit of his own work only.
+ The student will be required to develop a fully functional demonstration system that can confirm his modeling prediction, provide results that are at or above the project specifications, and show a creative component.
+ The student will have to identify a career path and show ability to fulfill the job requirements.
+ Show ability to help colleagues in different projects and possess knowledge of at least all project in the group and not only his own project.
+ The student is able to write, present and teach material form his research and its foundations.

Generally students take 5-6 years under my supervision to complete these requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements and time lines may compromise student funding at any point of their career.

#### Required skills for ALL e-Lab students:

+ basic digital VLSI and synthesis
+ basic HDL, verilog design
+ FPGA synthesis experience and use
+ basic neuroscience of the human visual system


#### e-Lab students need to know very well the following:

+ machine learning
CS 590: Introduction to Machine Learning, S V N Vishwanathan - http://learning.stat.purdue.edu/

+ computer architecture
ECE437 is a very heavy weight “beginner” course. Students write all the RTL, synthesize, and demonstrate an FPGA implementation of a MIPS pipelined dual core processor with cache coherency.
ECE 565 Computer Architecture by Mithuna S Thottethodi. ECE565 and 666 are the grad level architecture courses. While it depends on who happens to be teaching it, they are generally focused on extensive software modeling and benchmarking of various architectural trade-offs.
verilog and HDL coding
If you do not have background in HDL- based HW Design:
Please consider attending the first 5-6 weeks of lectures for ECE 337 ASIC Design (T-Th, 9:30-10:20, ME 1052)
Please let Dr. Mark Johnson know that you are a student from ECE 695R
ECE337 ASIC Design Lab – Primary objective is to teach students to use VHDL to implement RTL for hardware synthesis. Additional objectives: gain familiarity with an ASIC design flow, create test benches in VHDL.
system-on-a-chip design
ECE695 System-on-Chip Design, Anand Raghunathan, FALL - https://engineering.purdue.edu/elab/wiki/images/2/2b/ECE695-soc.pdf

+ digital VLSI design
ECE559 CMOS VLSI Design is probably the best starting point for this. There is an undergrad digital IC course that focuses on transistor level digital circuit design but it doesn’t get into physical layout.
Kaushik Roy has an advanced VLSI Design course. I seem to recall that the number is ECE688.
ECE 595Z Digital Logic Synthesis

+ analog VLSI design
ECE595 CMOS Analog IC Design, Byunhoo Jung
BME 595M ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS, Pedro Irazoqui

+ computer vision
ECE 661 : Computer Vision, Avi Kak, STILL OFFERED?
IE 590 (Fall 2010) Robotics & Machine Vision, Juan Wachs, STIL OFFERED?
neuroscience, vision system
BME528/ECE 528 “Measurement and Stimulation of the Nervous System”
psychology, vision system
Psy 627: Advanced Topics in Visual Perception, FALL - http://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~zpizlo/psy627.pdf
Each student will take a set of these courses, if not ALL, in order to focus his PhD thesis work.
