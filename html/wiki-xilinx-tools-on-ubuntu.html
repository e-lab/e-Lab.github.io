## Xilinx tools on Ubuntu

Unlike Windows, Xilinx tools on Ubuntu cannot be used out of the box, it requires installation of several dependencies before it can detect the JTAG cable in order to program the FPGA. The tutorial below serves as an installation manual in order to successfully install and use Xilinx tools on a Unix Machine.

## Ubuntu Xilinx Install

Tue Jun 11 17:44:18 EDT 2013

This README will describe how to install the Xilinx 14.4 tools on a clean 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS install. The 12.04 Ubuntu was chosen because it is the latest Long Term Supported release and so will be continuously updated until 2017.
At the time of written this README the Xilinx 14.5 tools have just come out, however, they are not the tool version that is being used in many of the tutorials and thus the 14.4 version will be installed for now. At some (near) future date an update will be added as to how to install the 14.5 Xilinx tools.

### Useful Tools

Programs to make the job easier.

#### UNetbootin (http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net)

From the website: UNetbootin allows you to create bootable Live USB drives for Ubuntu, Fedora, and other Linux distributions without burning a CD. It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. You can either let UNetbootin download one of the many distributions supported out-of-the-box for you, or supply your own Linux .iso file if you've already downloaded one or your preferred distribution isn't on the list.
This program was used along with some 1Gig USB drives to create some Linux boot disks. This make installing Ubuntu and making backup images of the computer easy.

#### Parted Magic (http://partedmagic.com)

The Parted Magic OS is a partitioning and system rescue environment. Booting your target computer into this live Linux distro provides the "Clonezilla" disk imaging application which will enable you to do a full disk backup of the computer. This is an easy save point if things go very badly wrong (which it will not).
The UNetbootin app has Parted Magic as an option for installing to a USB stick but for some reason it will not produce a bootable system. To get a bootable Parted Magic USB drive you will need to first install a working Linux distro (I tested DSLinux and Ubuntu) and then install on top if it Parted Magic. When UNetbootin ask if you want to overwrite any file say "Yes to All".

### Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64bit

If you want to make a backup of your original system using Parted Magic, now is the time to do it. This will provide you will the ability to restore your computer to it original state if needed.
The UNetbootin app has Ubuntu as an option to install to USB drive. Just make sure you select the 12.04_Live_x64 version. Using this boot media its easy to install on Ubuntu on your computer. There are tutorials on the web that you can look up you run into any problems.

### Install Xilinx 14.4 Tools

These instructions will install the Xilinx 14.4 syntheses tools. They will also install the USB driver used by Impact to load bitfiles into FPGAs and ensure installation of the CodeSorcery cross compiler that is bundled with the Xilinx tools.

#### Install dependent software packages

    sudo apt-get install -y vim  # optional
    sudo apt-get install -y libftdi-dev
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential git libusb-dev fxload ia32-libs

#### Reset /bin/sh

On Ubuntu the default system shell that is linked to /bin/sh is the dash shell. The dash shell is a light, fast loading shell that allows Ubuntu to boot faster when it is used. However, the use of dash will prevent the install of the CodeSorcery cross compile tools and so it needs to be changes.

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow dash

When asked to use dash as default system shell, select "NO"

#### Symbolically link make/gmake

At some point the gmake program is called explicitly. While GNU Make is installed on Ubuntu it has been named the default "make". Linking the two will prevent any problems.

    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/make /usr/bin/gmake

#### Download the Xilinx Tools

Select the 2012.4 version which corresponds to the 14.4 version of the tools from (http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm). You will need to make an account with Xilinx if you haven't already (its free).

#### Run Xilinx setup program

Melt the tarball and 'cd' into the Xilinx directory. Run the './xsetup' program that is found there. This opens up a graphical program that steps you through the installation process.
When asked, ensure that NO 'cable drivers' will get installed and I also always deselect the WebTalk install.
Once the install has finished check that the CodeSorcery tools have successfully installed. This is done be checking that the install location is populated.
    ls /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/EDK/gnu/arm/lin/

#### Install USB drivers

Assuming that the Xilinx tools were installed in the default location.

    git clone git://git.zerfleddert.de/usb-driver
    cd usb-driver
    make
    sudo ./setup_pcusb /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/ISE/

To talk to the Zedboard or any Digilent JTAG/USB device special drives need to be installed.

    cd /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin64/digilent/
    sudo ./install_digilent.sh /opt/Xilinx/14.4/ISE_DS/ISE/

The above install script will run in silent (non-interactive) mode. To use interactive mode, remove the path from the argument.
Now restart the udev service.

    sudo restart udev

For users using Xilinx 14.6 & ubuntu 12.04 on Parallels, try the following link if JTAG is still not detected.
http://lighttomorrow.wordpress.com/2011/12/18/how-to-install-digilent-cable-driver-for-xilinx-design-suite-on-ubuntu-11-10/

### Final Notes

The above steps should have installed the complete Xilinx 14.4 (2012.4) tool set. The biggest problem people often have is with the CodeSorcery install which will fail silently if things aren't just so.

## Xilinx tools usage on Ubuntu

+ Change the current directory to ISE_DS/ISE/bin/lin if you installed Xilinx tools in your home folder
+ Run "./impact" to open up impact
+ Open impact and wait for it to detect the FPGA
+ Once detected select the FPGA and right click
+ Select “load a new configuration file” and hit “program”
+ Load the FPGA with the configuration file provided on the elab server
+ Keep the FPGA in power on state as the configuration file will have to reloaded on restart
+ Make sure to reset the FPGA after running any demos/codes by using switch 10 as the reset button.
