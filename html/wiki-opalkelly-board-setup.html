## Opalkelly Board Setup


###Set up programming environments

#### Xilinx ISE Design Suite

ISE Design Suite, created by Xilinx, is the design tool we use for programming Xilinx devices. These devices can be programmed in either Verilog or VHDL and the Design Suite supports both of them. Users can verify, synthesize, implement and program their design. Since Opal Kelly XEM6001/6010 FPGA board uses the Xilinx chipset, the user needs to install ISE Design Suite before they can start programming. The Design Suite can be downloaded on Xilinx's webpage (http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm).

A user needs a license in order to run ISE Design Suite. If you are a student, you can get a student license on the Xilinx webpage for free (http://www.xilinx.com). The student license has a restriction that the user cannot program the XEM6010 board. You must have a purchased license if you are going to write a program for XEM6010.
Note: If you want to install Xilinx tools on Ubuntu, please refer to this article [Xilinx tools on Ubuntu]({{=$DOC.root}}html/wiki/xilinx-tools-on-ubuntu.html).


#### C++ Compiler

A C++ Compiler is required to run the algorithm that makes the PC communicate with the board. You can download MS Visual C++ 2010 [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express). Microsoft also has the [2008 version](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express) available. Once the software has been downloaded, follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. However, wxWidgets installation (see below) will NOT be easy in the 2010 edition. While MS support for 2008 exists, it is recommended to use the 2008 version.


#### wxWidgets GUI Library

wxWidgets is an open-source and cross-platform GUI library. Users can easily build GUI application on Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. You may download the wxWidgets library on their [webpage](http://www.wxwidgets.org/). Also refer to [this manual](http://www.rhyous.com/2009/12/16/how-to-compile-a-wxwidgets-application-in-visual-studio-2008/) when installing wxWidgets for MS Visual C++. This is for the 2008 versions and there are only minor differences for the 2010 version (internal to the VC software; the wxWidgets installation will be the same).


#### Opal Kelly FrontPanel Driver

FrontPanel driver is a system driver made by Opal Kelly, which is needed for detecting the FPGA board by the PC. This install package includes the various sample codes and documentations that are useful. You can find this package on eLab's server. The driver path is [smb://bmelab.ecn.purdue.edu/elab/software](smb://bmelab.ecn.purdue.edu/elab/software) (for Mac) or [\\bmelab.ecn.purdue.edu\elab](\\bmelab.ecn.purdue.edu\elab) (for Windows).
Both 32 and 64-bit versions are available. However, if you are compiling the cod using VC++ 32-bit build, then make sure to install the 32-bit version as otherwise the .dll files will not be compatible.


### Start with a tutorial given by Opal Kelly

This tutorial will help you make a simple 8-bit counter and program the XEM board.

Please find the tutorial at http://wiki.opalkelly.com/tutorial


### Useful statements for programming a XEM project

From the previous tutorial, you may understand how to create a project for the XEM board and how to download it to the XEM board. You can find additional explanations listed below. These might help you make your own project when you are dealing with the XEM board.


#### BIT configuration files

A bit file(*.bit) is used to describe the way the board works. It is generated from the HDL source code by Xilinx ISE Design Suite. Before starting your project, you should check the user's manual(specification) of your XEM board at here (http://www.opalkelly.com/products/) since host interfaces and PLL connections are different depending on the board.


##### UCF File

The UCF file includes the physical pin mapping and connection information of the target board. If you modify the project from one to another model, you have to replace the UCF file of Xilinx project with the right UCF file in the Opalkelly folder (default folder is "Program files/opal kelly/frontpanelUSB/").


##### Opal kelly endpoint connections

The expressions below corresponds to the port initialization.

    // instantiate endpoint connections
    okWireIn	wire_in (.ok1(  ), .ep_addr(  ), .ep_dataout(  ) );
    okWireOut	wire_out (.ok1(  ), ok2(  ), .ep_addr(  ), .ep_datain(  ) );
    okTriggerIn	trigger_in (.ok1(  ), .ok2(  ), .ep_addr(  ), .ep_clk(  ), ep_trigger(  ) );
    okTriggerOut	trigger_out (.ok1(  ), ok2(  ), .ep_addr(  ), .ep_clk(  ), ep_trigger(  ) );
    okPipeIn	pipe_in (.ok1(  ), ok2(  ), . ep_addr(  ), .ep_write(  ), .ep_dataout(  ) );
    okPipeOut	pipe_out (.ok1(  ), ok2(  ), .ep_addr(  ), .ep_read(  ), .ep_datain(  ) );

Each address of the ports is

    8'h00 - 8'h1F : Wire In port
    8'h20 - 8'h3F : Wire Out port
    8'h40 - 8'h5F : Trigger In port
    8'h60 - 8'h7F : Trigger Out port
    8'h80 - 8'h9F : Pipe In port
    8'hA0 - 8'hBF : Pipe Out port

This means that the wire out port will start at the he address 0x20 and this is what the C++ algorithm installed on the PC should look at when acquiring data.


##### FrontPanelHDL FIles

You must include FrontPanelHDL files in the project to use the host interface, wire-in/out, trigger-in/out, and pipe-in/out. They are located in the Opalkelly folder ("[Your Opal Kelly install folder]/frontpanelUSB/FrontPanelHDL/").


#### EXE executable files

The C++ executable file(.exe) will start transferring and controlling data between the PC and the FPGA. Users can define the way to transfer data and also the way to process data from the board. Before getting words from the board, the exe file loads a bit configuration file(*.bit) and downloads it to the FPGA board. Then, the program sends and receives words through WireIn, TriggerIn and PipeIn ports as defined in the source code. Since we use wxWidgets GUI library for creating applications and threads, wxWidgets is required to be installed.

Also, the C++ project must include two files below.

    okFrontPanelDLL.h
    okFrontPanelDLL.cpp

And the files below must be in the same directory as the 'EXE' file.

    okFrontPanel.dll
    configuration_file.bit (*.bit)


##### PLL frequency setting

The XEM6001 and XEM6010 boards have a PLL that can be programmed by the user. This allows an external application (such as a C++ algorithm running on a computer that is connected to the board) to control the frequency at which the program runs. The following is an example to set the PLL clock to 5MHz PLL frequency for the XEM6001 board.

    pll->SetReference(48.0f, false);
    pll->SetVCOParameters (100, 48);
    pll->SetDiv1 (okCPLL22150::DivSrc_VCO, 20);
    pll->SetOutputSource (0, okCPLL22150::ClkSrc_Div1ByN);
    pll->SetOutputEnable (0, true);

The list of functions supported by the Opal Kelly API can be found [here](http://www.opalkelly.com/library/FrontPanelAPI). Choose the appropriate PLL for your board.


##### FPGA Configuration with a bit file

The following expression corresponds to the configuration of a bit file.

    okCFrontPanel *xem = initialize_xem (configuration_file.bit);


##### Data input/output

The following expressions are for data input/output.

    value = xem->GetWireOutValue (0x20);
    xem->ReadFromPipeOut (0xA0, data_out_length, data_out_ptr);
    xem->SetWireInValue(0x01, 0x01, 0x01);

Note: 0x20, 0xA0, 0x01 are port address, which correspond to WireOut(8'h20 - 8'h3F), PipeOut(8'hA0 - 8'hBF) and WireIn(8'h00 - 8'h1F).


### Template for the graphical display of data

In the graphic template for XEM written by Berin Martini, you can use the two types of graphic display with the template, one is an image and the other is a plot. Before starting with the template, open and edit the DeviceInterface.h and DeviceInterface.cpp files. These files determine all types of communication which happened between PC and the board (i.e., board detection, board initialization, data transfer).


#### Display a graphic image

If you are going to draw an image, find the "MainFrame.cpp" and edit the header of it, for example,

    #include "GraphicsImage.h"
    //#include "GraphicsPlot.h"      // comment out

Also, find the "CreateGraphics" function in the "MainFrame.cpp" and activate the "GraphicsImage" declaration.

    GraphicsImage* graphicsPanel = new GraphicsImage (graphics);
    // GraphicsPlot* graphicsPanel = new GraphicsPlot (graphics);        // comment out

Now you can create your image display by editing these two functions below.

    void GraphicsImage::UnpackEvent ( )      // defined in GraphicsImage.cpp
    void GraphicsImageCanvas::SetData ( )    // defined in GraphicsImageCanvas.cpp

Once "UnpackEvent" function gets a data packet from the board, it labels a time index and changes the packet to the suitable form for use. It then sends the data array to the "SetData" function. The "SetData" function is the final step for the display routine and it determines the dimension of an image.


#### Display a graphic plot

If you are going to draw a plot, find the "MainFrame.cpp" and edit the header as shown below.

    //#include "GraphicsImage.h"        // comment out
    #include "GraphicsPlot.h"

Also, find the "CreateGraphics" function in the "MainFrame.cpp" and activate the the "GraphicsPlot" declaration.

    //GraphicsImage* graphicsPanel = new GraphicsImage (graphics);    // comment out
    GraphicsPlot* graphicsPanel = new GraphicsPlot (graphics);

Now you can create your plot by editing these two functions below.

    void GraphicsPlot::UnpackEvent ( )    // defined in GraphicsPlot.cpp
    void GraphicsPlotData::SetData ( )    // defined in GraphicsPlotData.cpp

Once "UnpackEvent" function gets a data packet from the board, it will label a time index and change the packet to the suitable form for use. It will then send the data array to "SetData" function. The "SetData" function is the final step and it determines the number of points for plotting.


#### Transfer link (USB)

The Opal Kelly board transfers data up to speeds of 38.2 MB/s. However, it is important to note that this speed is packet size dependent. Data will not be sent this fast regardless of how big or small the buffer in the FPGA is or how much it is filled to. See [this document](http://www.opalkelly.com/library/FrontPanel-UM.pdf) (pages 15-16) for information on how transfer rates change with respect to packet size.

Notice that the rate does not increase linearly. The increase is significant from 128 bytes to 16 kB. However, beyond that there is no significant increase in transfer speeds when compared to packet size (only about three times for a packet size increase of about 500).

As such, to maximize the speed benefits while not defining too large a buffer, a packet size of up to 4 kB (buffer width 13) on the XEM6001 and a size of up to 64 kB (buffer width 17) on the XEM6010 would be ideal.
