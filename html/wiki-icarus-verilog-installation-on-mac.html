## Icarus Verilog Installation on Mac OS X

### Icarus Verilog Installation

#### Obtaning source from git

You can obtain Icarus Verilog source from github.com (go to github.com or see the package repository for your Linux distribution)
Clone the source from github by using the command below

    git clone git://github.com/steveicarus/iverilog.git

The clone will create a directory, named iverilog, containing the source tree, and will populate that directory with the most current source from the HEAD of the repository.
And Change into this directory using:

    cd iverilog

Finally, configuration files are built by the extra step:

    sh autoconf.sh

The source is then compiled as appropriate for your system. See the specific build instructions below for your operation system for what to do next. You will need autoconf and gperf installed in order for the script to work. If you get errors such as:

    Autoconf in root...   
    autoconf.sh: 10: autoconf: not found   
    Precompiling lexor_keyword.gperf  
    autoconf.sh: 13: gperf: not found.

Then, you will need to install download and install the autoconf and gperf tools.


#### Compiling on Mac OS X

Since Mac OS X is a BSD flavor of Unix, you can install Icarus Verilog from source using the procedure described above. You need to install the Xcode software, which includes the C and C++ compilers for Mac OS X. The package is available for free download from Apple's developer site. (Note: You will need to install bison, flex, and g++) This is probably the easiest case. Given that you have the source tree from the above instructions, the compile and install is generally as simple as:

    ./configure  
    make install

The "make install" typically needs to be done as root so that it can install in directories such as "/usr/local/bin" etc.


### Startup example

Before getting started with actual examples, try the basic verilog example in order to make sure your installation is successful.
make new file with text editer, for example, using:

    vim hello.v

when creating a file to hold Verilog code, it is common to use the ".v" or the ".vl" suffix. This is not a requirement imposed by Icarus Verilog, but a useful convention. For the purposes of simulation, we use as our example the most trivial simulation, a simple Hello, World program.

    module main;
      initial 
       begin
          $display("Hello, World");
          $finish ;
       end
    endmodule

Then compile this program with the command:

    iverilog -o hello hello.v

The results of this compile are placed into the file "hello", because the "-o" flag tells the compiler where to place the compiled result. Next, execute the compiled program like so:

    vvp hello
    Hello, World

The "iverilog" and "vvp" commands are the most important commands available to users of Icarus Verilog. The "iverilog" command is the compiler, and the "vvp" command is the simulation runtime engine. What sort of output the compiler actually creates is controlled by command line switches, but normally it produces output in the default vvp format, which is in turn executed by the vvp program.
