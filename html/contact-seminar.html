### Bioengineering and Bioinspired Systems Seminar Series

#### Forthcoming:

2012 March 7th, **Maysam Ghovanloo**, Georgia Institute of Technology, **"From Implantable Microelectronic Devices to Modern Assistive Technologies"**, host: Eugenio Culurciello

**Abstract:** Implantable microelectronic devices (IMD) are finding applications in new therapies thanks to advancements in microelectronics, RF communications, and medical sciences, which have resulted in embedding more functionality in IMDs that occupy smaller space and consume lower power, while addressing more complex diseases and disabilities. I will address how we are pushing the limits on developing key building blocks for state-of-the-art IMDs, particularly on the analog front-end, RF back-end, and power management. IMDs have been quite successful in neuroprosthetic devices, such as cochlear implants and deep brain stimulators. They are also being considered for brain-computer interfacing (BCI) to enable individuals with severe physical disabilities to control their environments, particularly by accessing computers. Implantable BCIs, however, are highly invasive and it is not clear whether end users would accept them in the presence of less invasive alternatives. At GT-Bionics lab, we pursue implantable BCIs as advanced tools for neuroscience research applications on small freely behaving animal subjects. At the same time, we are exploring novel minimally invasive methods for individuals with severe paralysis to make the best use of their remaining abilities to control their environments. An example of such technologies is a wireless and wearable brain-tongue-computer interface (BTCI), also known as the Tongue Drive System, which enables individuals with quadriplegia to control their environments using their voluntary tongue motion.

**Bio: Maysam Ghovanloo** received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tehran, and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran in 1997. He also received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2003 and 2004.

Dr. Ghovanloo developed the first modular Patient Care Monitoring System in Iran where he also founded Sabz-Negar Rayaneh Co. to manufacture physiology and pharmacology research laboratory instruments. From 2004 to 2007 he was an assistant professor in the Department of ECE at the North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC. Since 2007 he has been with the Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, where he is an associate professor, the ON Semiconductor Junior Faculty Chair, and the founding director of the GT-Bionics Lab.

Dr. Ghovanloo is an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems and IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering. He has been serving on the Imagers, MEMS, Medical and Displays subcommittee of the International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) since 2009. From 2007 to 2011 he also served as the Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, Part II. He has received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the Tommy Nobis Barrier Breaker Award for Innovation, and Distinguished Young Scholar Award from the Association of Professors and Scholars of Iranian Heritage.
