## Torch7 Installation Guide

[Torch7](http://torch.ch) is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms.
This guide will help you install Torch7 on your system (Ubuntu on Intel/ARM, Mac OS X). Windows are not supported.


### Clean old versions of Torch7

Run the script below to remove old versions of Torch7 in your system in order to avoid conflicts.

	curl -s https://raw.github.com/torch/ezinstall/master/clean-old.sh | bash

<br>

### Torch 7 Installation on NN-X

Use the easy installation script below. These are taken and modified from [Torch7 github](https://github.com/torch/ezinstall).

	curl -s https://engineering.purdue.edu/elab/data/doc/install-0-deps-ARM | bash
	curl -s https://engineering.purdue.edu/elab/data/doc/install-1-torch-ARM | bash


<br>

### Torch 7 Installation on Ubuntu

Use the easy installation script below. More details can be found in [Torch7 github](https://github.com/torch/ezinstall).

	curl -s https://raw.github.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-all | bash


<br>

### Torch 7 Installation on Mac OS X

#### Required Mac OS X dependencies

+ homebrew: Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn't include with OS X
+ Xcode: It is a suite of tools developed by apple for developing software for Mac OS X and iOS
+ cmake: controls software compilation process of configuration files / automates the installation process when possible
+ wget: utility to receive files from the web using either http(s) or ftp protocol
+ readline: Provides a consistent user interface for recalling lines of previously typed input
+ Qt: Qt is a cross platform C++ application frame. provides a set of widgets with gui functionality
+ ffmpeg: Multimedia player, server, encoder and transcoder
+ gnuplot: command line driven plotting program
+ opencv: Open source Computer Vision is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real time computer vision developed by intel and now supported by Willow Garage (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/).
+ gcc >= 4.6: Necessary for multithreading support
+ CUDA library : if you want Torch to run on NVIDIA GPUs, you can download CUDA here: http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-40#MacOS


#### Install Homwbrew

These steps have been confirmed to work on multiple Macs.
Upgrading the operating system does not break the code.
However, upgrading brew or any related packages might.
Luarocks might be dependent on one another so if the installation of a Luarock fails, try the others and try that one again.
Before the installation, get Xcode (From the Apple App store) and then [Homebrew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation) as a replacement for MacPorts.

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"

after installation, update Homebrew

	brew update


#### GCC compiler for Multi-threading support

You will need to install GCC >= 4.6 to get proper multithreading support for Torch7 (a known MacOS issue); the easiest way to do that is to install GFortran is using brew, checking the last version and installing it; then export CC and CXX to point to the new GCC, before building Torch7:

	brew tap homebrew/versions
	brew search gcc

The most recent one (24 Jun 2013) is gcc49, so

	brew install gcc49
	which gcc-4.9
	which g++-4.9

Then copy the output of the last two commands and combine them as following:

	export CC=<output 1>
	export CXX=<output 2>
	
The script below will install Torch and its dependencies. This script might require you to be logged in as root. If so, do not do sudo. Sudo does not copy over CC and CXX vars and you will install with clang which is default on Macs. Clang does not have openMP support yet so all the above will be for nothing. Type in -

	sudo -s

#### Torch7 install script

Make sure you export CC and CXX again as above. Then do below or refer to [Torch7 github](https://github.com/torch/ezinstall).

	curl -s https://raw.github.com/torch/ezinstall/master/install-all | bash

When installation begins, the make script will check for whether OpenMP support is available with the current compiler. Installation output is verbose so make sure you find it before continuing.


<br>

### Additional Information

Here we listed our findings from the older or current versions of Torch7.
Just keep in mind that some of them are outdated but you can still refer to them when you are dealing with tedious errors.

#### QT support

Torch does not yet support Qt5. Make sure you get 4.8.x. x can be any version number - torch supports them all.

	cd /usr/local/Cellar
	brew versions qt


#### Installing BLAS Library (OpenBLAS)

OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library. It speeds up the computation time of mathematical task on Intel CPU.

	git clone https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS.git
	cd OpenBLAS
	make CC=clang
	make PREFIX=/usr/local install

For more information, you can refer to this page (http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/).


#### Installing MKL Intel Library

MKL (Math Kernel Library) is a proprietary of optimized math routines one of which is vector operations. It is developed by Intel Corporation and is "not" freeware. Install MKL from here:

	smb://bmelab.ecn.purdue.edu/elab/software/MLK library Intel

setting up MKL environment for bash

	export MKLROOT=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/compiler/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/lib export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/compiler/lib:/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/lib export NLSPATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/lib/locale/%l_%t/%N export MANPATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/man/en_US:/usr/local/share/man:/usr/share/man:/opt/intel/man:/usr/texbin/man:$ export INCLUDE=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/include export CPATH=/opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/include /opt/intel/composer_xe_2013.1.119/mkl/bin/intel64/mklvars_intel64.sh


#### parallel package

For the parallel package, you need to install zeromq (especially v2.2.0). You can switch the version.

	brew info zeromq
	brew switch zeromq 2.2.0
	luarocks install parallel

For the neuflow package, you need to install openmp first, then, install neuflow:

	brew install openmpi
	git clone git@github.com:clementfarabet/neuflow.git
	cd neuflow
	luarocks make

Now, you have Torch installed, and can add new package with command:

	luarocks install "package-name"


#### mattorch package

'mattorch' package is required if you want to load Matlab file(*.mat) in Lua. Before installing the mattorch package, Matlab should be installed on your computer. If you installed Matlab 2011a for Mac, the location of installed folder is different from the default location.

Reconfigurate MATLAB_ROOT by using

	export MATLAB_ROOT=/Applications/MATLAB_R2011a.app
	sudo luarocks install mattorch


#### Compile Error in camera package

PROBLEM: Oct 2012: camera package does not install with compiler: /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gcc

Solution: remove links to gfortran: export CC= export CXX= [echo $CCX should return nothing] then you can install fine


#### ffmpeg interface with Torch7

To run the Kalal's Dataset on Torch, You have to replace the init.lua in '/usr/local/share/torch/lua/ffmpeg' with the same file in [the repo](https://github.com/jtbates/lua---ffmpeg/tree/loaddump)


#### Reinstall Torch7

If you have a problem with Torch or dependencies and want to reinstall these packages, first you can remove them by doing

	cd `brew --prefix`
	rm -rf Cellar
	brew prune
	rm -rf Library .git .gitignore bin/brew README.md share/man/man1/brew
	rm -rf /Library/Caches/Homebrew

Then, reinstall brew with the command below

	ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"

Now you can come back to the beginning of this tutorial and start installing Torch.
